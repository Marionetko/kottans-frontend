> A very good article about adaptive web design. Easily explains the basic principles and capabilities of adaptive design. I first learned about Multicol and was pleasantly surprised since I am used to Flexbox and Grid. The article also explains the basic complexities that can arise when designing an adaptive web page.

> A good playlist that gives a basic understanding of working with Flexbox and a short task/tutorial. What I liked most about this tutorial is that the author shows how to work with such properties as `flex:` `order:` `flex-basis:` and others while even the paid courses from top companies often give you nothing but `justify-content:` and `align-items:`.
