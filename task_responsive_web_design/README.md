> A very good article about adaptive web design. Easily explains the basic principles and capabilities of adaptive design. I first learned about Multicol and was pleasantly surprised since I am used to Flexbox and Grid. The article also explains the basic complexities that can arise when designing an adaptive web page.

> A good playlist that gives a basic understanding of working with Flexbox and a short task/tutorial. What I liked most about this tutorial is that the author shows how to work with such properties as `flex:` `order:` `flex-basis:` and others while even the paid courses from top companies often give you nothing but `justify-content:` and `align-items:`.

> Very cool game. Passed in the same breath for 15 minutes and the last level even made me think for a while. The new thing I came across is the `flex-flow:` property, which combines the properties `flex-direction:` and `flex-wrap:`. The game was surprisingly useful :)

> Such a clear presentation of information on Grid layout I have not yet seen in any course. So I'll just leave this cheat sheet here: [CSS Grid Layout](https://fls.guru/grid.html)

> Like the Flexbox froggy - Grid garden is fascinating. The whole game passed in the same breath and with great pleasure. The last levels made me think hard. Enjoyed honing my skills in Grid layout in this interesting way.
