# Linux CLI, and HTTP

> I really liked this course. Simple and accessible presentation of information. I finally learned how to work with Linux without the graphical shell!

    <img src="https://github.com/Marionetko/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_linux_cli/quiz_03.jpg">
</details>

- Read articles:
    - [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know — Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)

    - [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know — Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155)

> The information given in the articles is quite confusing, I think this is solely due to the translation. The original articles are well written and the information is presented much better than in the translated version, which makes it easier to understand. For me personally, these articles didn't bring anything new to me, but they helped me remember some HTTP peculiarities and querying methods.

# Intro to HTML and CSS

1. Listen to Weeks 1 and 2 (to Introduction to Responsive Design) of the course [Intro to HTML & CSS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers)

My results:

<details>
    <summary>Week #1 Result</summary>
    <img src="https://github.com/Marionetko/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/week-01.jpg">
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Week #2 Result</summary>
    <img src="https://github.com/Marionetko/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/week-02.jpg">
</details>

> Pretty good basic HTML course. I just discovered a new online resource [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/). The course does a good job of describing a basic understanding of html and css. Reminded myself of some properties and tags that will never be redundant. The only pity - the course does not contain practical work, but you can make it up your own.


2. [Learn HTML(Eng)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

My results:

<details>
    <summary>HTML Result</summary>
    <img src="https://github.com/Marionetko/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/html.jpg">
</details>

>I haven't gotten around to this particular course in a long time. The presentation of information is pretty primitive, most of the interesting things are only on a subscription basis, which makes no sense at all. Why pay for the subscription when you can get the same information for free on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and it is much more interesting? Moreover, there is an updated section of web design and they translate their courses into Ukrainian. In general I did not like this course from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html). 

3. [Learn CSS(Eng)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)

My results:

<details>
    <summary>CSS Result</summary>
    <img src="https://github.com/Marionetko/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/css.jpg">
</details>

>Still convinced that [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is better in this respect.
