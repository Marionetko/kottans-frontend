> The information given in the articles is quite confusing, I think this is solely due to the translation. The original articles are well written and the information is presented much better than in the translated version, which makes it easier to understand. For me personally, these articles didn't bring anything new to me, but they helped me remember some HTTP peculiarities and querying methods.

> Pretty good basic HTML course. I just discovered a new online resource [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/). The course does a good job of describing a basic understanding of html and css. Reminded myself of some properties and tags that will never be redundant. The only pity - the course does not contain practical work, but you can make it up your own.

>I haven't gotten around to this particular course in a long time. The presentation of information is pretty primitive, most of the interesting things are only on a subscription basis, which makes no sense at all. Why pay for the subscription when you can get the same information for free on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and it is much more interesting? Moreover, there is an updated section of web design and they translate their courses into Ukrainian. In general I did not like this course from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html).

What I liked most about this tutorial is that the author shows how to work with such properties as `flex:` `order:` `flex-basis:` and others while even the paid courses from top companies often give you nothing but `justify-content:` and `align-items:`.

</details>

>I was already somewhat familiar with ES6 syntax, but this part of the tasks I found something new. I learned about Destructuring Assignment, Rest Parameter, Spread Operator. I learned how and where to apply them and for what purpose. I will keep some cheat sheets for the future.

**Prevent Object Mutation**
```js
let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad";
obj.newProp = "Test";
console.log(obj);
```
`Object.freeze();` - to prevent data mutation.

**Arrow function syntax**

```js
const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
```

When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keyword return as well as the brackets surrounding the code.

```js
const myFunc = () => "value";
```

It is possible to pass more than one argument into an arrow function.

```js
const multiplier = (item, multi) => item * multi;
multiplier(4, 2);
```

**Set Default Parameters for Functions**

```js
const greeting = (name = "Anonymous") => "Hello " + name;

console.log(greeting("John"));
console.log(greeting());
```

**Use the Rest Parameter**

With the rest parameter, you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function.

```js
function howMany(...args) {
  return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
}
console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2));
console.log(howMany("string", null, [1, 2, 3], { }));
```

**Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place**

```js
const arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
const maximus = Math.max(...arr);
```

Spread and Rest - allow to simply combine several arrays into one or pass values of individual array elements as function arguments. Interestingly, both of these operators look exactly the same in appearance - a ternary `(...)`, but are used in different cases, not only for arrays, but also for objects.

**Destructuring Assignment**

- Extract Values from Objects

```js
const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

const {today, tomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
```

- Assign Variables from Objects

```js
const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};
  
const { today : highToday, tomorrow : highTomorrow } = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
```

- Assign Variables from Nested Objects

```js
const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
  yesterday: { low: 61, high: 75 },
  today: { low: 64, high: 77 },
  tomorrow: { low: 68, high: 80 }
};

const { today : {low : lowToday, high : highToday}} = LOCAL_FORECAST;
```

- Assign Variables from Arrays

Destructuring an array lets us do exactly that:

```js
const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b);
```
The console will display the values of `a` and `b` as `1`, `2`.

The variable `a` is assigned the first value of the array, and `b` is assigned the second value of the array. We can also access the value at any index in an array with destructuring by using commas to reach the desired index:

```js
const [a, b,,, c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b, c);
```
The console will display the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as `1`, `2`, `5`.

- Reassign Array Elements with the Rest Parameter

```js
const [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7];
console.log(a, b);
console.log(arr);
```

The console would display the values `1`, `2` and `[3, 4, 5, 7]`.

Variables `a` and `b` take the first and second values from the array. After that, because of the rest parameter's presence, `arr` gets the rest of the values in the form of an array. 

- Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters

In some cases, you can destructure the object in a function argument itself.

```js
const stats = {
  max: 56.78,
  standard_deviation: 4.34,
  median: 34.54,
  mode: 23.87,
  min: -0.75,
  average: 35.85
};

const half = ({max, min}) => (max + min) / 2.0; 
```

**Create Strings using Template Literals**

```js
const person = {
  name: "Zodiac Hasbro",
  age: 56
};

const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}! I am ${person.age} years old.`;

console.log(greeting);
```

- Object Literal Declarations Using Object Property Shorthand

```js
const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({ x, y });
```

- Concise Declarative Functions

With ES6, we can remove the `function` keyword and colon altogether when defining functions in objects. Here's an example of this syntax:

```js
const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};
```

> In this Basic Data Structures course, I learned more about the differences between arrays and objects and which ones to use in different situations. I also learned how to use useful JS methods like splice() and Object.keys() to access and manipulate data. I'll also leave a little cheat sheet here.

`.push()` - adds elements to the end of an array.

`.pop()` - removes an element from the end of an array.

`.unshift()` - adds elements to the beginning of an array.

`.shift()` - removes an element from the beginning of an array.

`.splice()` - remove or add any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array.

`.slice()` - copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched.

`.indexOf()` - allows us to quickly and easily check for the presence of an element on an array.
