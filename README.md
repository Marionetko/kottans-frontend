# Linux CLI, and HTTP

- Take a course [Linux Survival (4 modules)](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/)

> I really liked this course. Simple and accessible presentation of information. I finally learned how to work with Linux without the graphical shell!

</details>

- Read articles:
    - [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know — Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)

    - [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know — Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155)

> The information given in the articles is quite confusing, I think this is solely due to the translation. The original articles are well written and the information is presented much better than in the translated version, which makes it easier to understand. For me personally, these articles didn't bring anything new to me, but they helped me remember some HTTP peculiarities and querying methods.

> In this course, I learned how to use git more confidently, solve marge conflicts, use fetch and rebase, and use remote repository correctly. I also understand how to build a collaborative workflow with others.

2. Complete the following levels [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=uk):
    - Main: Moving Work Around
    - Remote: To Origin And Beyond -- Advanced Git Remotes!

# Intro to HTML and CSS

1. Listen to Weeks 1 and 2 (to Introduction to Responsive Design) of the course [Intro to HTML & CSS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers)

My results:

<details>
    <summary>Week #1 Result</summary>

    <img src="https://github.com/Marionetko/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/week-02.jpg">
</details>

> Pretty good basic HTML course. I just discovered a new online resource [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/). The course does a good job of describing a basic understanding of html and css. Reminded myself of some properties and tags that will never be redundant. The only pity - the course does not contain practical work, but you can make it up your own.


2. [Learn HTML(Eng)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

My results:

<details>
    <summary>HTML Result</summary>
    <img src="https://github.com/Marionetko/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/html.jpg">
</details>

>I haven't gotten around to this particular course in a long time. The presentation of information is pretty primitive, most of the interesting things are only on a subscription basis, which makes no sense at all. Why pay for the subscription when you can get the same information for free on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and it is much more interesting? Moreover, there is an updated section of web design and they translate their courses into Ukrainian. In general I did not like this course from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html). 

3. [Learn CSS(Eng)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)

My results:

<details>
    <summary>CSS Result</summary>
    <img src="https://github.com/Marionetko/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/css.jpg">
</details>

>Still convinced that [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is better in this respect.

# Responsive Web Design

    <summary>Content of the article</summary>
    <img src="https://github.com/Marionetko/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_responsive_web_design/responsive_basics.jpg">
</details>

> A very good article about adaptive web design. Easily explains the basic principles and capabilities of adaptive design. I first learned about Multicol and was pleasantly surprised since I am used to Flexbox and Grid. The article also explains the basic complexities that can arise when designing an adaptive web page.

- [FLEXBOX](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM6XATa8CAG5mPV60dMmjMRrHVW4LmV2x)

</details>

> A good playlist that gives a basic understanding of working with Flexbox and a short task/tutorial. What I liked most about this tutorial is that the author shows how to work with such properties as `flex:` `order:` `flex-basis:` and others while even the paid courses from top companies often give you nothing but `justify-content:` and `align-items:`.

</details>

> Very cool game. Passed in the same breath for 15 minutes and the last level even made me think for a while. The new thing I came across is the `flex-flow:` property, which combines the properties `flex-direction:` and `flex-wrap:`. The game was surprisingly useful :)

- [CSS Grid Layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV92IdMGFfA&list=PLM6XATa8CAG5pXQrW_kDaeZb_uIAMNZIm)

> Such a clear presentation of information on Grid layout I have not yet seen in any course. So I'll just leave this cheat sheet here: [CSS Grid Layout](https://fls.guru/grid.html)

- [Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/) - Game

> Like the Flexbox froggy - Grid garden is fascinating. The whole game passed in the same breath and with great pleasure. The last levels made me think hard. Enjoyed honing my skills in Grid layout in this interesting way.

> I'm so used to checkbox styling that I had to remember pretty much everything from scratch. Awesome practice, the big challenge is just the design development.
