> A good and easy to understand course about DOM. I'll keep a few commands for myself as a reminder of the course material

`document.getElementById()` -  returns an Element object representing the element whose id property matches the specified string.

`document.querySelector()` - returns the first Element within the document that matches the specified selector, or group of selectors.

`.innerHTML` - gets or sets the HTML or XML markup contained within the element.

`.textContent` - property of the Node interface represents the text content of the node and its descendants. 

`.addEventListener()` - method of the EventTarget interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target.

`.shiftKey` - The KeyboardEvent.shiftKey read-only property is a boolean value that indicates if the <kbd>shift</kbd> key was pressed (true) or not (false) when the event occurred.

`.clientX` or `.clientY` - reads-only property of the MouseEvent interface provides the horizontal and vertical  coordinate within the application's viewport at which the event occurred (as opposed to the coordinate within the page).
