> Pretty good basic HTML course. I just discovered a new online resource [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/). The course does a good job of describing a basic understanding of html and css. Reminded myself of some properties and tags that will never be redundant. The only pity - the course does not contain practical work, but you can make it up your own.

>I haven't gotten around to this particular course in a long time. The presentation of information is pretty primitive, most of the interesting things are only on a subscription basis, which makes no sense at all. Why pay for the subscription when you can get the same information for free on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and it is much more interesting? Moreover, there is an updated section of web design and they translate their courses into Ukrainian. In general I did not like this course from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html).
